Description: An algorithm to fit prototype and exemplar categorization
    models. It uses the hill-climbing method of adjusting weight and
    sensitivity parameters to optimally fit data of experimental categorization
    tasks to the prototype and exemplar models. It can also produce graphs of
    these fits and take user-defined parameters to predict performance of
    a prototype or exemplar model strategy.
